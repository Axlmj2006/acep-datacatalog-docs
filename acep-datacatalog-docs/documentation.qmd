## Extensions
### Currently Installed
#### ckanext-customtheme
__Author__: Jenae Matson   
__Purpose__: Add custom theming and features for the CKAN instance, including   

- ACEP logos, colors, and fonts
- Home page layout, images, and featured dataset
- Changed font weight of Register button
- Added tags to search page display
- HTML file for About page text
- Removed social media links from dataset/resources pages
- Added support contact info to dataset sidebar
- Added default blank option to add-to-group dropdown menu

#### ckanext-faqpage
__Author__: Jenae Matson  
__Purpose__: Create an FAQ page linked in the masthead with collapsible boxes for questions and answers.  

#### ckanext-restrictpublish
__Author__: Jenae Matson  
__Purpose__: Restrict the ability to ochange the visibility of a dataset to admins only. Datasets posted by editors default to private.

#### ckanext-geoview
__Link__: [https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-geoview ](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-geoview)  
__Purpose__: Created resource views for geojson and other geo-data file types. We have implemented the OpenLayers Viewer.

#### ckanext-package-group-permissions
__Link__: [https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/ckanext-package-group-permissions](https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/ckanext-package-group-permissions)  
__Purpose__: Allows all editors and admins to add datasets to any group, without having to be added as members to each group.  
__Modifications__: This extension was created and works with CKAN 2.9. This instance is version 2.10, so the extension requires some small modifications to work. In the file `plugin.py`, change the following

#### ckanext-scheming
__Link__: [https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-scheming ](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-scheming)  
__Purpose__: Allows for the creation of alternate metadata templates (schemas) defined by .yaml or .json files.

### Adding Alternate Schemas with ckanext-scheming
1. Create a .yaml or .json file in the folder `ckanext-scheming/ckanext/scheming` to define the metadata schema. See extension documentatoin for more information and examples.  
2. In `ckan.ini`, add your schema to the `scheming.dataset_schemas` config option.  
```
def member_create(self, next_auth, context, data_dict):
    """
    This code is largely borrowed from /src/ckan/ckan/logic/auth/create.py
    With a modification to allow users to add datasets to any group
    :param context:
    :param data_dict:
    :return:
    """
    authorized = False
    if context.get('controller') in ['package', 'dataset'] and context.get('action') in ['groups']:
        authorized = helpers.user_has_admin_access(include_editor_access=True)


    if not authorized:
        # Fallback to the default CKAN behaviour
        return next_auth(context, data_dict)
    else:
        return {'success': True}
```
3. The new dataset creation form is located at a url defined by the schema type name. For example, the creation form for datasets of type `arctic-dataset` is located at `/arctic-dataset/new`. You can define a new Add Dataset button using this new url.

### Attempted Extensions
#### ckanext-spatial
__Link__: [https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial ](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial)  
__Purpose__: This extension adds the ability to search for datasets on a map widget, as well as a dataset extent map widget on the dataset page, provided correct geospatial metadata.  
__Problems__: This extension is not currently installed due to the following,  

- Configuring map tiles for ckanext-spatial caused the map tiles for ckanext-geoview to disappear.
- Datasets with the required spatial metadata were not searchable on the map search widget, although the dataset extent widet worked correctly.
